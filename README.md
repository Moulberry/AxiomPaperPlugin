# Axiom Paper Plugin for Serverside Implementation

**IMPORTANT:** This is the Paper Plugin for the Axiom Serverside Implementation. To use the mod, you can download it from the [Axiom Modrinth Page](#).

Axiom is an all-in-one tool for Minecraft editing. It merges the capabilities of 3D software with a sleek interface and an innovative toolset. Axiom simplifies Minecraft building while elevating its potential. Real-time previews and client-side rendering, powered by specialized algorithms, enhance both visual feedback and performance while building.

## Commercial Use

**IMPORTANT:** In order to use Axiom on multiplayer, you must either have a commercial license or request a whitelist on the Axiom Discord.

We ask that 'Professional Builders' (i.e. people who make money through building in Minecraft) purchase a Commercial License. The commercial license unlocks the full potential of Axiom to power your commercial endeavors and provides several one-of-a-kind features such as:

- **Multiplayer Support:** Collaborate with others on private build servers using Multiplayer Support.
- **Custom Server APIs:** Leverage powerful server APIs like serverside custom blocks to accelerate development.
- **And more to come!** Axiom is constantly updating. Additional Commercial License features will be available soon.
